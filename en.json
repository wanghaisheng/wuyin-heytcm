    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "How accurate is the Five Senses Test?",
      "a1": "Our Five Senses Test is designed based on extensive scientific research and Chinese medicine theory, validated by thousands of users with an accuracy rate exceeding 95%. The test employs a multi-dimensional assessment method to ensure reliability and stability of results.",
      "q2": "How soon will I see effects from the five-tone or five-color healing plan?",
      "a2": "Most users begin to experience noticeable effects after consistently using the plan for 2-4 weeks. Minor issues (such as mild anxiety, decreased sleep quality) typically improve within 2 weeks, while chronic issues (such as long-term stress, mood swings) may require 1-3 months of continued practice.",
      "q3": "Do I need a professional music or art background?",
      "a3": "Not at all. Our five-tone and five-color healing plans are designed to be simple and accessible for everyone, regardless of music or art background. The plans include detailed guidance and instructions to ensure you can easily get started.",
      "q4": "What if I'm sensitive to both music and colors?",
      "a4": "This is completely normal! Many people have sensitivity to both music and colors, just to different degrees. Our test will assess which sensory sensitivity is stronger and prioritize the corresponding healing plan. In our advanced packages, we provide comprehensive five-tone and five-color healing plans to address multiple sensory sensitivities.",
      "q5": "How much time does the five-tone or five-color healing plan require daily?",
      "a5": "Basic healing exercises only require 10-15 minutes daily, suitable for busy modern individuals. You can flexibly arrange to do them after waking up in the morning or before bed at night. Intensive exercises for specific health goals may require 20-30 minutes, but the frequency can be adjusted according to individual circumstances.",
      "q6": "Can I get support if I have questions after purchase?",
      "a6": "Absolutely. All packages include email support services, and the Professional and VIP packages also include one-on-one expert consultation services. Our professional team will promptly address any questions you encounter during practice to ensure you achieve the best healing effects."
